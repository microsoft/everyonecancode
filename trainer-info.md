# Last Minute Notes for Trainer
> [!NOTE]
> We have now backup accounts that should be suffient to provide everyone to have access to shared AppService Plans for WebApps in the "asharedplan" resource group. If more plans are needed coaches can provision additional plans in this group.

> [!CAUTION]
> We ran into a technical issue while pre-provisioning the AppServicePlans for the workshop. There is a very high likelyhood that this is **not resolved by the time of the event**.
> To continue working on the hands on track despite AppServicePlans (and therefore WebApps) not being available you have following options:
>
> 1.) Priorize the [Python Programming Track](https://github.com/microsoft/everyonecancode-us), it only uses Azure WebApps in the very last step.
>
> 2.) Ask Participants to Sign Up for a Free Account. All resource can be created on the free tier. This **requires a credit card and comes with the risk of creating payed resources by accident**!
>
> 3.) Ask Participants to use our pre-deployed backend at: [https://everyonecancode-backend-a151.azurewebsites.net/](https://everyonecancode-backend-a151.azurewebsites.net/) and ignore the backend configuration steps.
> 
> 4.) We have created fallback accounts for regions relying on translated versions of the original EveryoneCanCode Milligram track (Japan and France). We also have a the possiblity to hand out accounts on two shared fallback regions with limited capacity. Please reach out to our orga team for these.
