"""
This module is the entry point for the Azure Function.
It is responsible for handling the HTTP request and passing it to the FastAPI app in the root folder.

Azure Functions do not support streaming repsonses, so we can not stream images from the storage account yet.
Hopefully this will be supported in the future.
